/*
Design an OOP architecture in JavaScript for the collision problem in week 8. Refactor the code into an OOP framework,
emphasizing architectural design choices without using external libraries or AI tools. You may use general OOP,
javascript and math resources but do not use code from other frameworks or projects to base your architecture.

Requirements:
1. Architecture Design:
   - Develop a framework that effectively manages the interactions and dynamics of colliding objects.
     Focus on selecting and justifying OOP design patterns and structures that best fit the needs of the simulation.
   - Ensure that the architecture supports the addition of multiple objects with various behaviors and interactions.

2. Core Principles:
   - Apply key OOP principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and abstraction to create a clean and scalable codebase.
   - Provide flexibility in the system design to allow future enhancements and integration of new object types
     or collision behaviors without significant restructuring.

3. Implementation Specifics:
   - Maintain a focus on creating a system that is easy to understand and maintain.
   - Use vanilla JavaScript, with external files allowed solely for organizing classes and related functions.
